# Mangaroo DevLog

This is the start of an authentic and energetic devlog about why and how I built Mangaroo. 
I will justify all of my design choices by sharing my thought processes for every decision I made as I was building Mangaroo. 
I have also included the most frequently asked questions (and the questions that I asked myself!) into this devlog to answer the most common concerns about the project! 
I would appreciate any feedback you may have!
